# WizardScrolls
Welcome to WizardScrolls, the DiscordJS Bot for OSR Fantasy RPGs. This bot is designed to assist game masters and players in running Old School Renaissance (OSR) style games such as Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) and Old School Essentials (OSE) via Discord.

WizardScrolls is an ongoing project that aims to evolve and address the needs and requirements of OSR RPG players. Currently, the bot's primary functionality is generating rolls, and character sheets for DCC will be added in the next version.

We are committed to providing a high-quality and reliable experience to all users of WizardScrolls. We welcome your feedback, bug reports, or feature requests, as they can help improve the bot's performance and utility.

Thank you for choosing WizardScrolls, and we hope it enhances your OSR gaming experience on Discord.
